/** <h1> 3 Sum </h1>
 * 
 * <p> The classic 3-sum problem: find all (unique) triplets in an integer
 * array that sum to zero </p>
 * 
 * <p> I take the approach of reducing to the 2-sum problem on a sorted
 * list, so the run time is <code>O(n^2)</code> with no additional
 * space (other than the space required for the returned list). </p>
