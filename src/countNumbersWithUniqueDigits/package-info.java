 * Count Numbers With Unique Digits </a> </p>
 * 
 * <h2> Questions </h2>
 * 
 * <p> None, it's pretty clear-cut </p>
 * 
 * <h2> Thinking </h2>
 * <ul>
 * <li> Enumeration strategy is way too long.  Do this instead by counting. </li>
 * </ul>
 * 
 * <h2> Difficulties during implementation </h2>
 * 
 * <ul>
 * <li> Begin by attempting to do outside of IDE.  </li>
 * <li> Hmm... seemed to hit it on the first try.  </li>
 * <li> Somewhat slow to submitted answers.  No, I made a cached solution
 * and it was just as slow.  Probably has to do with order of submission or
 * something?  </li>
 * </ul>
