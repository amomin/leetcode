/** <h1> Integer Break </h1>
 * 
 * <p> Given a positive integer n, break it into the sum of at least two 
 * positive integers and maximize the product of those integers. Return 
 * the maximum product you can get.</p>
 * 
 * <p>For example, given n = 2, return 1 (2 = 1 + 1); 
 * given n = 10, return 36 (10 = 3 + 3 + 4).</p>
 * 
 * <p>Note: You may assume that n is not less than 2 and not larger than 58.</p>
