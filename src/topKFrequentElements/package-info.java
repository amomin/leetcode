/** <h1> Return Top k Frequent Elements </h1>
 * 
 * <p> Return the k values in an array of integers that
 * occur most frequently in the array.  The constraint
 * is that the solution <strong>must be</strong> "better"
 * than <code>O(n log(n))</code> </p>. </p>
 * 
 * <h2> Solution </h2>
 * 
 * <p> Straightforward approach using a hashmap to keep counts
 * and a priority queue to hold the top k of those counts 
 * (after the counts have been collected). </p>
